# SelfdrivingCarWithTensorflow
 little car game with a kinematic model in pyglet and a learning algorithm in Tensorflow.

 The game is written with pyglet. For the car a kinematic model was used. The neural net in Tensorflow gets 8 values, which describe the distances in 8 directions. Reinforcement learning was used to learn the actions.

 The principle of the learner was shown, but the implementation isn't completely finished.
